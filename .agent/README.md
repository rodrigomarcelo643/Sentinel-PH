## 🚀 Project Overview

**SentinelPH** is a community intelligence network for early health outbreak detection in the Philippines. It enables everyday Filipinos (sari-sari store owners, tricycle drivers, market vendors) to report health observations validated through AI-powered trust scoring and multi-source verification.

**Track:** 3 – Good Health and Well-Being

## 🔑 Key Principles

- Mobile-first, offline-capable PWA
- AI-powered trust scoring (0-100)
- 3-Sentinel Rule for multi-source validation
- Two-way feedback loop with communities
- Multi-layered spam prevention
- Community empowerment over surveillance
