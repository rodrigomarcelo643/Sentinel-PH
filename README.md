**Track:** 3 – Good Health and Well-Being

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The Philippines has no shortage of health data—it has a shortage of the right data at the right time. The current approach to outbreak detection is reactive, seeing outbreaks only after hospital admissions spike—when it's already too late for prevention. Communities themselves—the people who notice the first fever, the first child with diarrhea, the first neighbor who looks sick—have no structured way to share what they see.

## 💡 Solution

SentinelPH builds a community intelligence network that trains and equips everyday Filipinos—including sari-sari store owners, tricycle drivers, market vendors, traditional hilots, and religious leaders—to become the first line of outbreak detection in their own neighborhoods with built-in safeguards that separate genuine signals from noise and misinformation.

## 👥 Target Users

**Primary Users (Community Sentinels):**
- Sari-Sari Store Owners & Market Vendors
- Tricycle Drivers & PUV Operators
- Barangay Tanods & Leaders
- Religious Leaders & Church Workers
- Traditional Healers & Hilots
- Barangay Health Workers

**Beneficiaries:**
- Entire Communities (faster detection = faster response)
- Vulnerable Populations (elderly, children, pregnant women, PWDs)
- Municipal & Provincial Health Officers
- Department of Health & Epidemiologists

## ✨ Key Features

## 🔑 Core Innovation

Instead of asking communities to report symptoms (which feels like surveillance), SentinelPH asks them to report **what they observe** (which feels like community participation):
- More people buying paracetamol than usual?
- Several children absent from community gatherings?
- Neighbors mentioning the same illness?
- Families boiling water after floods?

## 🎯 What Makes This Different

- **Taps Informal Observers** - First system designed for sari-sari stores, tricycle drivers, market vendors
- **Observation-Based** - "What do you see?" not "Who is sick?" (reduces privacy concerns)
- **Incentivized Participation** - Real rewards tied to verified accuracy
- **Multi-Layered Spam Prevention** - Progressive onboarding, rate limiting, AI filtering
- **3-Sentinel Rule** - Multiple unrelated sources required before alerts
- **Two-Way Communication** - Closes the loop with communities
- **Proximal Intelligence** - Catches outbreaks at pre-clinic stage
- **Community Empowerment** - Active participants, not passive data sources

## 💰 Revenue Model

**LGU & Health System Subscriptions (85%):**
- Barangay Plan: ₱300/month (up to 20 sentinels)
- Municipal Plan: ₱1,500/month (unlimited sentinels, advanced analytics)
- Provincial Plan: ₱4,000/month (regional pattern detection, API access)

**Partnerships & Services (15%):**
- Telecom partnerships (load credit revenue share)
- NGO health program integration
- Corporate CSR sponsorship
- Training & certification services
- Anonymized data research licenses
